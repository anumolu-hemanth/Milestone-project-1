                    <b>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO)</b> expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it 
                    pioneered when it was launched 19 years ago. CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and 
                    game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.). <br> <i>"Counter-Strike 
                    took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game 
                    in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999," said Doug Lombardi at Valve. &nbsp; 
                    "For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline 
                    competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. 
                    CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the 
                    next gen consoles and the Mac."</i>
